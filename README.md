Created the Styling, timer, and buttons.

When the buttons are clicked, if the answer is correct, time is added to the timer.
If the answer is wrong, time is taken off of the timer.

Had difficulty getting past this point. Will need to make better use of office hours in the future, as well as askBCS in Slack.
